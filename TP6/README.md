## TP6 : Bezier surfaces

Today, we start working with surfaces, which means transition from 2D to 3D. 
We will use OpenGL for rendering, but don’t worry if you have little or no 
experience with OpenGL; a wrapper class `Viewer` is provided. 
Adding a surface patch is as easy as calling
```python
viewer.add_patch(X,Y,Z)
```

First, we need to setup the required python packages `PyOpenGL` and `PyGLFW`. Do
```bash
cd geonum2020/
git pull
```
or, if you don't have the local repo
```bash
git clone https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/geonum/geonum2020.git
cd geonum2020/
```

You should have the `TP6/` and `viewer/` folders, plus two bash scripts: `setupPackages.sh` and `exportPath.sh`.
Execute the following commands:
```bash
# download and extract packages
. setupPackages.sh
```

This will download and compile `PyOpenGL`, `PyGLFW` and `GLFW` (as a static library).
The `libglfw.so*` files are automatically copied to repo's root dir.
For the viewer to function properly, **python scripts need to be executed from the root dir**.

Moreover, the $PYTHONPATH needs to be set up everytime you open the terminal by executing `exportPath.sh` preceded by the dot.
```bash
. exportPath.sh
```
You can `echo` the path to see if it's been set correctly.
```bash
echo $PYTHONPATH
```

Afterwards, you can test the viewer with
```
# test the viewer
python viewer/viewer.py
```

For the TP6, you can pass datanames and density directly as command line args:
```bash
cd TP6
python tp6.py  [simple,wave,sphere,heart,teapot,teacup,teaspoon]  [density=10]
```

### Alternative Viewer: Using matplotlib
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111,projection='3d')
ax.axis('equal')
ax.axis('off')
...

for p in range(numpatch) :
    ...
    ax.plot_wireframe(X, Y, Z)
    ...

plt.show()
```
---

### Representation
On the implementation level, the biggest difference between curves and surfaces is the representation we'll use.
Before, we used a single matrix to represent the whole curve -- each coordinate was stored in a separate column.
For surfaces, we could do something similar using three-dimensional arrays; instead, to facilitate understanding of the code, we'll represent the three coordinates in separate matrices `Mx`, `My` and `Mz` (or `Sx`, `Sy`, `Sz` for surface points).

### Functions to modify
* `DeCasteljau` : implement the De Casteljau algorithm for surfaces.
* `BezierSurf` : compute Bezier surface points.

### ToDo
1. Implement the evaluation of Bézier surfaces for (u,v) in [0,1]².
Use `simple` and `wave` for first tests (these contain only one patch).
2. When you're sure the implementation works for the simple cases, test your algorithm on datasets with multiple patches:
`heart` (2),  `sphere` (8),  `teapot` (32), `teacup` (26), `teaspoon` (16). Don't set the `density` parameter too high, always start with smaller values (5 or 10) as the number of computed points is `density`².
